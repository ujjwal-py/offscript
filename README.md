# Offscript

Offscript is a fullstack blogging and social publishing platform built with React, TypeScript, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Supabase. Users can create drafts, submit posts for moderation, manage published content, search and like public posts, upload images, and authenticate securely with JWT cookies. Administrators can review pending submissions, approve or reject content, and remove published posts when necessary.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ recommended
- npm
- A PostgreSQL database, such as Supabase Postgres
- A Supabase project if image storage is enabled

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ujjwal-py/typescript-social-media.git
cd offscript

cd server
npm install --include=dev

cd ../client
npm install
```

The server's `postinstall` script runs `prisma generate` automatically. The generated Prisma client is placed under `server/src/generated/prisma` and is not committed to Git.

## Backend environment variables

Create `server/.env` from `server/.env.example`:

```env
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="replace-with-a-long-random-secret"
NODE_ENV="development"
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"
SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-server-side-service-role-key"
SUPABASE_BUCKET="your-storage-bucket-name"
```

Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, or `JWT_SECRET` in frontend code or commit them to Git.

## Frontend environment variables

Create `client/.env`:

```env
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

The Axios client automatically appends `/v1`, so the value should not include `/v1`.

## Run locally

Open two terminals.

### Backend

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

The API runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

The Vite development server runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Available scripts

### Frontend

```bash
npm run dev       # Start Vite development server
npm run build     # Type-check and create production build
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
npm run preview   # Preview the production build locally
```

### Backend

```bash
npm run dev       # Start nodemon with tsx
npm run build     # TypeScript build/type-check
npm start         # Start the server with tsx
npm test          # Placeholder test script
```

## Database and Prisma

The Prisma schema is located at `server/prisma/schema.prisma`.

```bash
cd server
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name describe-your-change
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Use `migrate dev` for local schema changes. Use `migrate deploy` in production after migrations have been committed. The `postinstall` script only runs `prisma generate`; it does not modify database tables or data.

## API routes

The API is mounted under `/v1`.

### Authentication

| Method | Route        | Auth     |
| ------ | ------------ | -------- |
| `POST` | `/v1/signup` | Public   |
| `POST` | `/v1/signin` | Public   |
| `GET`  | `/v1/me`     | Required |
| `POST` | `/v1/logout` | Required |
| `GET`  | `/v1/users`  | Public   |

### Posts

| Method   | Route                   | Auth     |
| -------- | ----------------------- | -------- |
| `GET`    | `/v1/posts`             | Public   |
| `GET`    | `/v1/search-public`     | Public   |
| `GET`    | `/v1/drafts`            | Required |
| `GET`    | `/v1/published`         | Required |
| `GET`    | `/v1/search-user-posts` | Required |
| `POST`   | `/v1/new-post`          | Required |
| `PUT`    | `/v1/update-post/:id`   | Required |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/delete-post/:id`   | Required |
| `POST`   | `/v1/like-post/:id`     | Required |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/dislike-post/:id`  | Required |

## Production deployment

### Backend on Render

Set the Render service root directory to `server`.

```text
Build Command: npm install --include=dev && npm run build
Start Command: npm start
```

Required Render environment variables:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=your-supabase-postgres-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-production-secret
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SUPABASE_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
```

### Frontend on Vercel

Set the Vercel root directory to `client` and set:

```env
VITE_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
```

Build command:

```bash
npm run build
```
